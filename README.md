### First Person Shooter Game (Multiplayer) ###

* This is a game I'm working on my time off just to practice and learn making games, and program. I really want to become an game developer so doing this is just fun for me.

### Can I download this project and make it my own? ###

* Theoretically yes, but I really do not want anyone to download the repo without asking. I do get that you might want to contribute, but I rather want to get a comments than actually having people downloading it and changing it without permission. So come with improvment suggestions, but please don't try to download it.

### Staff ###

* Currently it's only me and my friends. I'm the only one who programs, but I do get insights from my friends when it comes to testing and design changes.
* I do hope that one of my friends wants to learn unity and programming so I can ask for some help from him and so we can learn together! He is the only one so far I will permit to download and contribute practically.
